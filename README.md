Minecraft Chat Speaker
======================

This program will read the log files generated by the Minecraft client 
and filter log lines as they're written for chat lines. The program will 
then output the line to the GUI and also speak it with a random voice 
for each player. Uses Microsoft SAPI.

Note the program only currently works for servers that use '<' and '>' 
to delimit player names. Configuration options and better parsing will 
be implemented later.
